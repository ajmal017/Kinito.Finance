# ## Variables

# *Suggested Answers follow (usually there are multiple ways to solve a problem in Python).*

# Create a variable with name "x" and a value of 10. Execute.

# In[1]:


x = 10


# Tell the computer to show you the value of that variable.

# In[2]:


x


# Can you think of a second way to obtain the same result? 

# In[3]:


print (x)


# On the same line, create four new variables: a,b,c, and d, that are equal to 10, 20, 30, and 40, respectively.

# In[4]:


a,b,c,d = (10,20,30,40)


# Alternatively:

# In[5]:


a,b,c,d = 10,20,30,40


# Tell the computer to show you the value corresponding to the variable "b".

# In[6]:


b


# Alternatively:

# In[7]:


print (b)


# Do the same for "d".

# In[8]:


d


# Or:

# In[9]:


print (d)
