# Let x represent the number of orders received during a certain day. 
# Assign 102 to x. Create a program that prints "A busy day" if x is greater than 100, and "A calm day" otherwise. Change x to 97 to verify your code works properly.

# In[1]:


x = 102

if x > 100:
    print ("A busy day")
else:
    print ("A calm day")
