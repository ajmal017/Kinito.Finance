# ## Iterating over Dictionaries
# In this exercise you will use the same dictionaries as the ones we used in the lesson - "prices" and "quantity". This time, don't just calculate all the money Jan spent. Calculate how much she spent on products with a price of 5 dollars or more.
# In[ ]:
prices = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 4,
    "lasagna"  : 5,
    "hamburger" : 2
   }
quantity = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 6,
    "lasagna"  : 10,
    "hamburger" : 0
    }
money_spent = 0
# In[ ]:

# And how much did Jan spent on products that cost less than 5 dollars?
# In[ ]:
prices = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 4,
    "lasagna"  : 5,
    "hamburger" : 2
   }
quantity = {
    "box_of_spaghetti" : 6,
    "lasagna"  : 10,
    "hamburger" : 0
    }
money_spent = 0
