# ## Calculating the Return of Indices

# *Suggested Answers follow (usually there are multiple ways to solve a problem in Python).*

# Consider three famous American market indices â€“ Dow Jones, S&P 500, and the Nasdaq for the period of 1st of January 2000 until today.

# In[1]:


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as wb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# In[2]:


ind_data = pd.read_csv('D:\Python\Indices_Exercise_Data.csv', index_col='Date')


# In[3]:


ind_data.head()


# In[4]:


ind_data.tail()


# Normalize the data to 100 and plot the results on a graph. 

# In[5]:


(ind_data / ind_data.iloc[0] * 100).plot(figsize=(15, 6));
plt.show()


# How would you explain the common and the different parts of the behavior of the three indices?

# *****

# Obtain the simple returns of the indices.

# In[6]:


ind_returns = (ind_data / ind_data.shift(1)) - 1

ind_returns.tail()


# Estimate the average annual return of each index.

# In[7]:


annual_ind_returns = ind_returns.mean() * 250
annual_ind_returns
