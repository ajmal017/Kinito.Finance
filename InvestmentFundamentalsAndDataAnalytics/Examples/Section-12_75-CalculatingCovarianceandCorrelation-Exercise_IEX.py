# ## Calculating Covariance and Correlation

# Consider a portfolio composed of *Walmart* and *Facebook*. Do you expect the returns of these companies to show high or low covariance? Or, could you guess what the correlation would be? Will it be closer to 0 or closer to 1? 

# Begin by extracting data for Walmart and Facebook from the 1st of January 2015 until today.

# Repeat the process we went through in the lecture for these two stocks. How would you explain the difference between their means and their standard deviations?

# \begin{eqnarray*}
# Covariance Matrix: \  \   
# \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
#         \sigma_{1}^2 \ \sigma_{12} \ \dots \ \sigma_{1I} \\
#         \sigma_{21} \ \sigma_{2}^2 \ \dots \ \sigma_{2I} \\
#         \vdots \ \vdots \ \ddots \ \vdots \\
#         \sigma_{I1} \ \sigma_{I2} \ \dots \ \sigma_{I}^2
#     \end{bmatrix}
