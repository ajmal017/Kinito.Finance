# *Hint: The code we went through in the lecture is what you need here. You will need to import the data first. The previous lessons could be a good reference point for that! :) *

# \begin{eqnarray*}
# Covariance Matrix: \  \   
# \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}

#         \sigma_{21} \ \sigma_{2}^2 \ \dots \ \sigma_{2I} \\
#         \vdots \ \vdots \ \ddots \ \vdots \\
#         \sigma_{I1} \ \sigma_{I2} \ \dots \ \sigma_{I}^2
