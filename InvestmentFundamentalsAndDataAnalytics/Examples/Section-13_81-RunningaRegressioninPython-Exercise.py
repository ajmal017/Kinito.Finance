# ## Running a Regression in Python

# *Suggested Answers follow (usually there are multiple ways to solve a problem in Python).*

# *A teacher at school decided her students should take an IQ test. She prepared 5 tests she believed were aligned with the requirements of the IQ examination.
# The father of one child in the class turned out to be an econometrician, so he asked her for the results of the 30 kids. The file contained the points they earned on each test and the final IQ score.*

# Load the IQ_data excel file.

# Prepare the data for a univariate regression of Test 1 based on the IQ result. Store the Test 1 scores in a variable, called X, and the IQ points in another variable, named Y.

# Create a well-organized scatter plot. Use the “axis” method with the following start and end points: [0, 120, 0, 150]. Label the axes “Test 1” and “IQ”, respectively.

# Just by looking at the graph, do you believe Test 1 is a good predictor of the final IQ score?
