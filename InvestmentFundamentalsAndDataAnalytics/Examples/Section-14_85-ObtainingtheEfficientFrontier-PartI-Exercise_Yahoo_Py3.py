# ## Obtaining the Efficient Frontier - Part I
# We are in the middle of a set of 3 Python lectures that will help you reproduce the Markowitz Efficient Frontier. Let’s split this exercise into 3 parts and cover the first part here. 
# Begin by extracting data for Walmart and Facebook from the 1st of January 2014 until today.
# In[ ]:

# Do a quick check of the data, normalize it to 100, and see how the 2 stocks were doing during the given timeframe. 
# In[ ]:

# In[ ]:

# Calculate their logarithmic returns.
# In[ ]:

# Create a variable that carries the number of assets in your portfolio.
# In[ ]:

# The portfolio need not be equally weighted. So, create a variable, called “weights”. Let it contain as many randomly generated values as there are assets in your portfolio. Don’t forget these values should be neither smaller than 0 nor equal or greater than 1! <br />
# 
# *Hint: There is a specific NumPy function that allows you to generate such values. It is the one we used in the lecture - NumPy.random.random().*
# In[ ]:

# Sum the obtained values to obtain 1 – summing up the weights to 100%!
# In[ ]:
