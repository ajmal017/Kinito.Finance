# ## Obtaining the Efficient Frontier - Part II

# *Suggested Answers follow (usually there are multiple ways to solve a problem in Python).*

# Ok, letâ€™s continue the exercise from the last lecture.

# You already downloaded the data and generated two random weightings. 

# In[1]:


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as wb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

assets = ['WMT', 'FB']
pf_data = pd.DataFrame()

for a in assets:
    pf_data[a] = wb.DataReader(a, data_source = 'yahoo', start = '2014-1-1')['Adj Close']


# In[2]:


log_returns = np.log(pf_data / pf_data.shift(1))

num_assets = len(assets)

weights = np.random.random(num_assets)
weights /= np.sum(weights)
weights


# Now, estimate the expected Portfolio Return, Variance, and Volatility.

# Expected Portfolio Return:

# In[3]:


np.sum(weights * log_returns.mean()) * 250


# Expected Portfolio Variance:

# In[4]:


np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(log_returns.cov() * 250, weights))


# Expected Portfolio Volatility:

# In[5]:


np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T,np.dot(log_returns.cov() * 250, weights)))


# ***

# The rest of this exercise will be a reproduction of what we did in the previous video.

# 1)	Create two empty lists. Name them pf_returns and pf_volatilites.

# In[6]:


pfolio_returns = []
pfolio_volatilities = []


# 2)	Create a loop with 1,000 iterations that will generate random weights, summing to 1, and will append the obtained values for the portfolio returns and the portfolio volatilities to pf_returns and pf_volatilities, respectively.

# In[7]:


for x in range (1000):
    weights = np.random.random(num_assets)
    weights /= np.sum(weights)
    pfolio_returns.append(np.sum(weights * log_returns.mean()) * 250)
    pfolio_volatilities.append(np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T,np.dot(log_returns.cov() * 250, weights))))
    
pfolio_returns, pfolio_volatilities


# 3)	Transform the obtained lists into NumPy arrays and reassign them to pf_returns and pf_volatilites. Once you have done that, the two objects will be NumPy arrays. 

# In[8]:


pfolio_returns = np.array(pfolio_returns)
pfolio_volatilities = np.array(pfolio_volatilities)

pfolio_returns, pfolio_volatilities
