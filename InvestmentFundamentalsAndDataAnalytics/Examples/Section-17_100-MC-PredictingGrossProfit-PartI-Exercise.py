# Imagine you are an experienced manager and you have forecasted revenues of \$200mln, with an expected deviation of $10mln. You are convinced Cogs will be near 40% of the revenues, and their expected deviation is 20% of its own value. 
# Use NumPyâ€™s random.random function to simulate the potential revenue stream for 250 iterations (which is the number of trading days in a year) and then the predicted Cogs value.
